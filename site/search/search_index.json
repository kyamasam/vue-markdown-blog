People expect systems to fail, hopes to go unfulfilled and relationships to end in the gutter. Somehow all of this negativity has infiltrated the church and Christians have also come to an acceptance of this pseudo reality.</p> <p>1 Sam 17 16 For forty days the Philistine came forward every morning and evening and took his stand.</p> <p>23 As he was talking with them, Goliath, the Philistine champion from Gath, stepped out from his lines and shouted his usual defiance, and David heard it. 24 Whenever the Israelites saw the man, they all fled from him in great fear.</p> <p>Sometimes when the message of failure is repeated to us over and over, we begin to believe it, and we run away at the mention of it. The devil is described as being \"like a roaring lion\".</p> <p>1 Peter 5 7 Give all your worries and cares to God, for he cares about you. 8 Stay alert! Watch out for your great enemy, the devil. He prowls around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour. 9 Stand firm against him, and be strong in your faith. Remember that your family of believers all over the world is going through the same kind of suffering you are.</p> <p>The significant bit here is that when we have worries, the devil roars around \"like a lion\". He makes his noises in the midst of your worry to scare you into even more worry. But we are called to stand firm in faith. When you hear the devils roaring and scaring you into worry and discouragement, remember that there is one who is the real lion of Judah!</p> <p>We have his breath in our lungs, his spirit is indwelling in us. The waves and the wind obey him. He calls darkness into light, He is the one who moves mountains, causes dead bones to rise into armies and calls out creation from nothingness.</p> <p>Today I prophesy over the areas of nothingness in your life, I call to the areas that have been dejected to come to life like great armies. I pray for visions of glory, and sights of the greatness of God to be revealed to you. May God open your eyes like those of Gehazi, so that in the midst of your worry and fear, you will see the lion of Judah covering you. And you will rest in his shadow during the days of the scorching sun, and that he will lead you into green pastures and peaceful meadows. I speak peace where there has been worry, and joy where there has been sorrow. Go forth into victory you mighty warrior. You got this, not because of who you are, but because of who God is.</p> <p>Sam</p>"},{"location":"sections/God/god-an-introduction/","title":"God, An Introduction","text":""},{"location":"sections/God/god-an-introduction/#a-dying-son","title":"A dying son","text":"<p>It was a calm evening,the sun was setting as the sheep were entering their shed. Mary was doing the final touches on her dinner. It had been a while since Joseph died. Her children were all grown by now. Safe for the occasional sound  of the bleating sheep and the children playing from a distance, the silence was loud. She could never get herself to get rid of his carpentry workshop,  too many memories there. He loved working with his hands, and always made the finest tables. She remembered taking him food there as he taught Jes and the other kids the ins and outs of wood work.</p> <p>She sat at the dinner table, right across where he would have sat. All the chairs were empty, her sons were gone too, busy living  their lives. She said the grace on her own, but she couldn't bring herself to eat her dinner. There was a sinking feeling in her belly. She couldn't understand it. It was strangely familiar, she had felt it just before Joseph died. The agitation in her spirit, the restlessness in her heart coupled with the premonition of the end of a season. </p> <p>Jes' was on the mountain, He knew the time had come. He wished he could have just one more day, if only to see his mother one last time. He went on His knees to pray,  but no words came out of His mouth. The surety of death was on his mind. He touched his face, alas, blood! \"Wait, I must not be seeing clearly. Where did that come from? It must be sweat\", He thought. Under the light of the moon He checked again, it was blood. He was in such grief He knew He needed  someone on his side, but all his friends were asleep. Just when He needed them most, they couldn't comfort Him. Suddenly the soldiers came, grabbing  Him by His cloak, they took Him to the town square. It was all happening too fast.</p> <p>There was no protecting Him from the crowd that longed for his execution. His crimes are worse than treason they said. He calls himself  a king they remarked. He surely deserved death by their words. Mary heard the commotion from her house. She looked out through her tiny living room window. It was her son. They had stripped Him of his cloak and were flogging Him to death by the pillars of the town square. Suddenly it hit her. The sinking  feeling, they were going to kill her beloved son. There was no way back for Him now. She followed wailing as they whipped Him to  the rocky, barren hills. He saw her following from a distance, but He couldn't look her in the eye. He shed a tear as He turned away in  shame and grief. </p> <p>They hang her son that day on a cross, and all the while He never said a word. As He hung his head and breathed His last mortal breath, she felt the dagger go through her heart, the pangs of heartbreak in her mouth, the pain of a dying son. She loved Him dearly. </p> <p>If you haven't figured it out by now, this story is about Mary and her son Jesus, and my imagination of a simplified version of the story. You can find the story in Mark 15 here. He died for the sake of you and me. </p>"},{"location":"sections/God/god-an-introduction/#a-world-of-hurting-people","title":"A World Of Hurting People","text":"<p>There's something about pain and tragedy that we cannot put on paper, or explain if we wanted to. It pushes us to seek a power beyond ourselves, an existential guide if you would call it. The answer to our questions. An encounter with the divine, an encounter with  God.

He feels, He gets angry, He gets jealous, and most of all He Loves, in fact He likes  to be called Love. He understands the human condition, that 66 volume love letter talks about how He became a man, lived and walked  among men. He came under the full wrath of angry and confused men, He experienced the warm hug of friendship and the bitter kiss  of betrayal. He was stripped naked by angry men and spat on by shouting women. He died in the hands of the very men He cared most about.</p> <p>Meet the God who understands the plight of man kind, one who hates sin but loves the sinner at the same time. </p> <p>In this series, I'd like to attempt to present God to you, and maybe He will appeal to you.
