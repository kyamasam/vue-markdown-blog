# Go forth, you mighty warrior !

We live in a country and a world where people believe the worst and the least out of everything. People expect systems to fail, hopes to go unfulfilled and relationships to end in the gutter. Somehow all of this negativity has infiltrated the church and Christians have also come to an acceptance of this pseudo reality.


> **1 Sam 17**
> **16** For forty days the Philistine came forward every morning and evening and took his stand.
>
> **23** As he was talking with them, Goliath, the Philistine champion from Gath, stepped out from his lines and shouted his usual defiance,
> and David heard it. **24** Whenever the Israelites saw the man, they
> all fled from him in great fear.

Sometimes when the message of failure is repeated to us over and over, we begin to believe it, and we run away at the mention of it. The devil is described as being _"like a roaring_ lion".

> **1 Peter 5**
> [7](http://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-7.htm) Give all your worries and cares to God, for he cares about you.
> [8](http://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-8.htm) Stay alert! Watch out for your great enemy, the devil. **He prowls around like a roaring lion**, looking for someone to devour.
> [9](http://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-9.htm) **Stand firm against him, and be strong in your faith.** Remember that your family of believers all over the world is going through the same kind of suffering you are.

The significant bit here is that when we have worries, the devil roars around "_like a lion"_. He makes his noises in the midst of your worry to scare you into even more worry. But we are called to stand **firm in faith.** When you hear the devils roaring and scaring you into worry and discouragement, remember that there is one who is the real lion of Judah!

We have his breath in our lungs, his spirit is indwelling in us. The waves and the wind obey him. He calls darkness into light, He is the one who moves mountains, causes dead bones to rise into armies and calls out creation from nothingness.



Today I prophesy over the areas of nothingness in your life, I call to the areas that have been dejected to come to life like great armies. I pray for visions of glory, and sights of the greatness of God to be revealed to you. May God open your eyes like those of Gehazi, so that in the midst of your worry and fear, you will see the lion of Judah covering you. And you will rest in his shadow during the days of the scorching sun, and that he will lead you into green pastures and peaceful meadows. I speak peace where there has been worry, and joy where there has been sorrow. Go forth into victory you mighty warrior. You got this, not because of who you are, but because of who God is.
