# God, An Introduction

## A dying son
I was a calm evening, the sheep were entering their pens. The sun was setting. Mary was doing the final touches on her meal.
It has been a while since Joseph died. Her children were all grown by now, the silence was loud, safe for the occasional sound 
of the sheep and the children playing from a distance. She had never gotten rid of his carpentry workshop, she could never get herself
to do it. Too many memories there. 

She sat at the dinner table, right across where he would have sat. All the chairs were empty, her sons were gone too, busy living 
their lives. She said the grace on her own, but she couldn't bring herself to eat the food. There was a sinking feeling in her belly.
She couldn't understand it. It was strangely familiar, she had felt it just before Joseph died. The agitation in her spirit,
the restlessness in her heart coupled with the sadness of the end of a season. 


Her son Jes' was on the mountain, He knew the time had come. He went on His knees to pray, but no words came out of His mouth. The surerity
of death was on his mind. He touched his face, alas, blood ! "Wait, I must not be seeing clearly. Where did that come from?
It must be sweat", He said, under the light of the moon He checked again, it was blood. He was in such pain of heart that he knew he needed 
someone. But all his friends were asleep. When he needed them most, they couldn't comfort him. Suddenly the soldiers came, grabbing 
him by his cloak, they took him to the town square.

There was no protecting Him from the crowd that wanted to stone Him. His crimes are worse than treason they said. He calls himself 
a king they said. He surely deserved death by their words. Mary heard the commotion from her house. She looked out through the window. It was her son.
They had stripped him of his cloak and were beating him to death by the pillars of the town square. Suddenly it hit her. The sinking 
feeling, they were going to kill her beloved son. There was no way back for Him now. She followed wailing as they flogged him to 
the rocky hills. He saw her following from a distance, but He couldn't look her in the eye. He shed a tear, as he turned away in 
shame and grief. 

They hang her son that day on a cross, and all the while He never said a word. As He breathed His last mortal breath on that day,
she felt the dagger go through her heart, the pangs of heartbreak in her mouth, the pain of a dying son. She loved Him dearly. 

If you haven't figured it out by now, this story is about Mary and Jesus son is Jesus, and my imagination of a simplified version of the story.

## A World Of Hurting People
There's something about pain and tragedy that we cannot put on paper, or explain if we wanted to. It pushes us to seek a power beyond
ourselves, an existential guide if you would call it. The answer to our questions. An encounter with the divine, an encounter with 
God. I wish I could explain Him, He refuses to be put into words. He's like a person, you can describe them, 
their qualities, show me their photos, but I can never really know what they're like until I meet them. 

## The Person
Unlike many philosophies that describe God as a force of the universe, I'd like to present a person, a friend. He writes letters by the way,
He has a 66 book volume about Him and by Him. He feels, He gets angry, He gets jealous, and most of all he Loves, in fact he likes 
to be called Love. He understands the human condition, that 66 volume love letter talks about how He became a man, lived and walked 
with men. He came under the full wrath of angry and confused men, he experienced the warm hand of friendship and the bitter kiss 
of betrayal. He was stripped naked by angry men and spat on by shouting women. He died in the hands of men.

Meet the God who understands the plight of man kind, one who hates sin but loves the sinner at the same time.
