# Self Deception
```
James 1
22 Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says. 
23 Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like someone who
looks at his face in a mirror 24 and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately
forgets what he looks like. 25 But whoever looks intently into the perfect law that gives
freedom, and continues in it—not forgetting what they have heard, but doing it—they will be 
blessed in what they do.

I've come to observe two kinds of Christians, those who listen to sermons online all the time and those who never do. I'm 
somewhere in between. I listen to sermons while driving, sometimes when I'm free or washing dishes. I realised something 
however, that there are times when the listening can become a form of passtime, or self medication just to tell myself I'm 
doing okay, while never really doing what I hear. 

Not studying my bible and thinking that sermons can make up for that 
Not praying, and waiting for any sign, that seems to align to what I want to do.

"you ask for a sign but the oly sign is that of Jonah"
