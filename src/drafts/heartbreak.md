It was a normal evening, after a day of work, I was exhausted, but more demotivated than confused really. 
I was thinking about making a tough choice in my life. I thought I was going to get shattered inside. There was no going back from this. 
I thought about all the ways the conversation would go, the tears, the anger the disappointment. No picture in my head
was ever quite enough. I mulled over the details, I practiced the response in my head, I appeared before the court 
of my conscience, I presented my case, and prepared my partner's defence. I became my own judge. 
At the jury of my emotions, and under the law of an irrefutable God, I had lost my case.

I recounted my mistakes.I had come to my wits end, I had broken another's heart and shattered my own, but I had come to myself.
I was going to face the jail of my pain and pay the fine of my misgivings. I had no one to blame but myself.
Faced by reality, no one's answers seemed right to me, they were simmers of light, but they couldn't illuminate my dark world. 
I was okay on the outside, but I felt broken inside. That's when the words of an assuring father, who speaks of 
an ubreakable promise began to resonate in my ears. I felt like a prodigal. I had come to myself. 
"What have I done?", I asked myself... "I'm a logical person", I thought. Life should be linear, and things ought to add up.
One plus one equals 2 right? Make my happy I make you happy, both of us are happy right ? Not so sure... Not every time. 

## A world of hurting people
Heartbreaks change us, I know... I went through one, I caused one. Yet sometimes we have to make choices that allow us to move
on to the next phase of our lives. I've come to discover that often when people hurt us, it's just because they are hurting 
inside too. Learning this has allowed me to be kinder to others because I know that there are many ways in which I'm hurting too.


## Becoming a better person
Sometimes when relationships crumble around us, it's easier to blame those around us and become the victim in our own stories.
You may not be able to change others, but you can change yourself. I genuinely believe that our relationships become better
when we work on becoming better people ourselves.

## Becoming the partner you would like to have
We all have a proverbial list... What we often forget is that everyone else has their list too. We can be so focused on
making sure that we find someone that fits our list that we forget that we also need to tick boxes in their list too.
I made a challenge for myself, to become the kind of partner I would like to have. I won't lie, it's one of the hardest things
you can do, and that probably means it's the right thing to do. I mean, if you can't walk in the shoes of your partner, why do
 you think they should ?

## Give them a break
You can never negotiate on character, but you can't also forget that just like you, people are learning too. Moral of the 
story, be kind to your partner, perhaps they will be kind to you too.
