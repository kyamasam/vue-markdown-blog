It was a normal evening, after a day of work, I was exhausted, but more demotivated than confused really. I was thinking about making
a tough choice in my life. I thought I was going to get shattered inside. There was no going back from this. I thought about all the ways
the conversation would go, the tears, the anger the disappointment. No picture in my head was ever quite enough. I mulled over the details,
I practiced the response in my head, I appeared before the court of my conscience, I presented my case, and prepared my partner's defence. I became
my own judge. At the jury of my emotions, and under the law of an irrefutable God, I had lost my case.

I recounted my mistakes.I had come to my wits end, I had broken another's heart and shattered my own, but I had come to myself.
I was going to face the jail of my pain and the fine of my misgivings. I had no one to blame but myself.
Faced by reality, no one's answers seemed right to me, they were simmers of light, but they couldn't illuminate my dark world. I was okay on the outside, but I felt broken inside.
That's when the words of an assuring father, who speaks of an ubreakable promise began to resonate in my ears. I felt like a prodigal.
I had come to myself. "What have I done?", I asked myself... "I'm a logical person", I thought. Life should be linear, and things ought to add up.
One plus one equals 2 right? Make my happy I make you happy, both of us are happy right ? Not so sure... Not every time.
