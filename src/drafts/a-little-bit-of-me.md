# A Little Bit Of Me

I have this dream of building a house one day, its more about creating a space where I can feel home. Thinking about what makes
me feel home is an interesting thing. I have to consider how I live now and how I can create space that is unique to me, and that 
adapts to my lifestyle. A little bit of me one would say. 

In my day job, I work as a software engineer, which is just a big title for someone who creates software, you know the thing 
that runs your phone, or this blog you're reading right now. Every day, my tasks revolve around creating products that people 
interact with daily. I have to think about how those products make the lives of those who use them easier. Every software
developer thinks differently, and given one problem, two people would solve it in their own way. The solutions I create ultimately
reflect my biases, thought patterns, emotions and my skills. In short, every product I create has a little bit of me written 
all over it. 

What does this have to do with God? I'm glad you asked. The more I think about God, the more I see that He is not so different 
from us. You see, my desire to build a home or to create software is a lot about creating things that reflect my thought patterns and how I see the 
world. 

## Imago Dei
The story of creation is a fascinating story. Because it speaks about a God who created a territory then created people to live in it.
These people were just like Him, they had His image. 

```
26 Then God said, “Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals,[a] and over all the creatures that move along the ground.”

27 So God created mankind in his own image,
    in the image of God he created them;
    male and female he created them.
    Genesis 1
```
Why would a God create something like this ? Well, to extend his territory, to colonise a new space for himself.


## The paradox of choice
If he created the universe to extend his kingdom, or his territory, you'd think he would want to control everything in it, 
including the humans in it. Let me play the devil's advocate here. Why would someone just build a place and just let the 
people in it just do what they liked? He either doesn't care what they do or trusts them to do what is "right" or He values the 
idea of choice. Or maybe the idea that a God created this place is just insane. I tend to belive that for this whole kingdom
idea to work, at least in the long term one requires choice. The idea of choice means that one can literally just choose to 
reject the idea of God, and that's still fine. If there is a God, and one chooses to live like He doesn't exist, that doesn't
negate His possible existence, it just means that one has made a choice. 

Some of the most meaningful relationships we create are based on choice. You choose the friends that you feel share your values,
and when they choose you back, you can start the journey of building a friendship. The idea of God i'd like to present to you
is one of relationship, a God who presents Himself to you and let's you choose Him.


## Control
Control, we often think we have control. Control over our environment, how we feel and most outcomes we experience. In many cases, 
this is true. I often think that in many ways, the world is just too chaotic for the notion of control, especially of outcome. Think about 
the simple idea of birth. Well, it is a series of biological events, that produce a being aware of their own existence, who's 
able to make choices in the world, but life itself doesn't really prresent us with a choice of whether we would like to start 
experiencing it. I mean, no one asked me if I would like to be born, that's crazy if you ask me. After I have become aware of 
my own existence, I do have to choose daily if I would like to continue living. I am however ultimately doomed to existence. 

## Questions
I'm certainly not the first to ask these questions, neither I'm I an expert at answering them but I've learnt however, that 
my questions far outweigh my answers. I'm a very logical person, and Science definitely answers many of them. I'd like to
live in a perfectly logical world, but unfortunately the world is not very logical sometimes. I've heard this quote by C.Clarke, 
"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.", and one could argue, that some day, a civilisation 
more advanced than us will be able to answer existential questions by measuring them in a lab. Well, I do not know about that, but 
for now, I have something that has worked in my life.

## Answers 
Maybe existential questions are meant to be answered by means that transcend logic. That's how I see God. The idea of God 
transcends logic. Let's call these answers faith. Maybe I can present to you a world where God does not compete with Science,
He doesn't claim to be Science, but really an idea above Science. If we live in a three dimensional world, and Science
operates in the realm of 3 dimensions, then I would think about God as existing in a fourth dimension.

## Enough of the complicated explanations, you're losing me ...
### Meaning
The idea of God to me presents an answer to meaning. A meaning for why I was born on this strange planet with people
trying to get me to watch ads on YouTube. I mean does YouTube Tv have to have so many ads?!! I digress. In my next article,
I will present God to you, as the Bible explains it, then let you be the judge. I hope you are still with me...
