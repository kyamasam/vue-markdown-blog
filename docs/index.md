### About Me :sunglasses:
![Image title](./assets/portrait-photo-samuel.png){ align=left }

I am a `Senior Software Engineer based in Kenya`. I love writing code that solves real life problems and helps business owners thrive by leveraging the power of software.  Besides creating software, I love God. When I'm not staring at my laptop, I'm probably in a church somewhere. 

I have hobbies too :) I love music, so I'll probably always have an ear warm at any given time.




### My Software Development Journey :material-road-variant:
#### Discovery :bulb:
I encountered computers in a high school lab at Starehe Boys Center. My passion was ignited when I discovered that I could write simple bash scripts to automate my workflow. Since then, I have never looked back. 

#### BSC Computer Science, University Of Nairobi :fontawesome-solid-graduation-cap:
I studied at "The University" as they like to call it. At UoN I the technicalities of software engineering and got the principles that allowed me to become a Software Engineer today


#### My Work :tools:
I have been priviled to work on projects in Kenya and Tanzania and my work has been used by over `30 million people`. Most notably, I was the lead engineer in building [chanjo.health.co.ke](https://chanjo.health.co.ke/) and [portal.health.co.ke](https://portal.health.co.ke) for the Kenya government. This platform went on to be used during the Covid-19 Pandemic by over `17 Million Kenyans` for vaccination. Certificates generated on the platform were verified and recognized by other countries including the Uk government.

You can see more cool stuff I have worked on under the [portfolio section of this website](sections/portfolio/software-development-portfolio.md).


#### Technology stack :fontawesome-brands-node-js: :material-language-python:
I primarily build applications using `Vue Js ` and `python` - `Django Rest Framework`
